Question 1:

In the java programming language, all source code is first written in plain text files ending with the .java extension.
Those source files are then compiled into .class file by the jdk javac compiler 

In C language the GNU compliler compiled into .obj,.bak,.exe and in C++ compiled into .obj,.exe
In java the javac compiler compiled into .class file

The .class file contains bytecodes which is only understand by java virtual machine(jvm)

jre with jvm interpret the bytecode and run the java application

Inside Jvm Architecture

    class loader:
        class loader load the .class file into jvm memory
    bytecode verifier:
        bytecode verifer the .class file is valide or not
    JIT/AOT:
        These are used to increase the execution speed
    Security Manager:
        These manages the security of the .class file

Question 2:

Java SE
    Java SE is Standard Edition provides fundamental components of java applications, including the JVM,JRE and JDK.Used for simple application and basic business logic.

Java EE
    Java EE is Enterprise Edition Bulid upon Java SE,offering Additional APIs for larger,scalable applications.Used for Wed-related tasks,messaging,security and more.

Java ME
    Java ME is Micro Edition Desigined for embedded and mobile devices with resource constraints. Includes specific APIs for sensors,Bluetooth, and location services.

why it is named as Jdk,J2SE,Java SE

JDK(Java Development Kit)
    The JDK is the toolkit provided by Sun Microsystems for building Java applications.
    It includes essential tools like the Java compiler, debugger, and runtime environment.
    The name "JDK" emphasizes its role in developing java applications

J2SE(Java 2 Platform,Standard Edition)
    Initially, java was released as Java 1.0, When version 1.2 arrived, it brought siginificant enhancements
    To distinguish this major upgrade from the original java 1.0, Sun Microsystems rebranded it as Java 2.
    The "2" in J2SE signified this leap in features.
    The "SE" stands for Standard Edition

Java SE(Java Standard Edition)
    In 2004, Sun Microsystems simplified the naming scheme.
    They dropped the "2" from J2SE and renamed it to Java SE.
    This change aimed to avoid confusion.
